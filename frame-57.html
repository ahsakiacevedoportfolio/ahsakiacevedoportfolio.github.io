            <p class="arte-is-a-mobile-app avenirnext-medium-black-16px">
              Arte is a mobile app that focuses mainly on small business and self employed users. This app has a little
              bit of what a lot of people want like:<br /><br />Statuses<br />Commission section<br />Can only upload
              photos no videos<br />Work examples<br />Customizable profiles<br />Top artist of the month
            </p>
            <div class="user-research">User Research</div>
            <p class="i-did-research-on-a avenirnext-medium-black-16px">
              I did research on a few apps that are popular at the moment to see what were the good and the bad of it.
              <br /><br />A lot of people love instagram, but they were noticing how they were trying to make it into a
              video app and forgot that what people actually want is for it to stay mainly for photos.
            </p>
            <p class="what-users-want-is-t">
              What users want is to have an app that can do mostly everything. They want an app that is for posting
              photos and for it to be easy to commission from small businesses. Users wants to only see their followers
              post, but also have an option that they can get a commission from an artist and do it all in the app
              instead of having to email them.
            </p>
            <p class="roxy-is-a-social-med">
              Roxy is a social media manager who also provides commissions on Etsy as part time. She spends her time
              drawing on her tablet and posting on a few different social medias to make sure anyone can commission her.
            </p>
            <p class="one-of-the-biggest-c avenirnext-medium-black-16px">
              One of the biggest competitors would be Instagram. The problem with instagram is that they seem to be
              changing in a negative way where they are focusing mostly on video, but that isn’t what the users want.
              There were a few features that instagram has which was added to Arte.
